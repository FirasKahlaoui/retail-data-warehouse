## Data Warehouse Project with SQL Server

This project demonstrates the construction of a fully functional Data Warehouse using SQL Server 2022 and Visual Studio 2022. It includes:

- **Database Design**: Creation of dimension tables and a fact table for a retail sales scenario.
- **ETL Processes**: Implementation of ETL pipelines to load and transform data from staging tables into the final schema.
- **Data Generation**: Python scripts to generate synthetic datasets for testing.
- **KPI Analysis**: SQL queries to calculate key metrics, such as total sales, top-selling products, and revenue by region.

The repository includes SQL scripts, Python scripts for data generation, and documentation on setting up and running the project.
